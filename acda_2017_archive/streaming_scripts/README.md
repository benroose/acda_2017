# streaming_scripts

### streaming.sh
Primary script to start a local webserver, webstream the desktop display, and webstream a simple video input. Requires python and vlc on Linux.

NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION IN REALTIME STREAMING. Has ~30 second delay on stream. Would be fine if realtime streaming is not needed.

All other files are either supporting data for streaming.sh or test scripts.
