Blank template submission files for LibreOffice and Microsoft Office can be found in templates sub-directory.

### File edits and pull requests
If a visiting institution team member wishes to edit or submit changes to a file within this repository then this can be accomplished in one of two methods:

1. The file can be downloaded from the acda_2017 github repository using the web interface, locally edited, and then emailed to the technical director, Ben Roose ([ben.roose@gmail.com](mailto:ben.roose@gmail.com)). Ben will then upload the newly received file to this repository. Note that due to nature of this method, there will be limited version control and tranparency available.

2. A github pull request can be made allowing for full version control and transparency to the submitted changes:
  1. The acda_2017 can be locally cloned using git clone: [Cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)  
   2. The file can then be locally edited and a pull request made: [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) 
   3. The ACDA technical team will review the pull request and merge submitted changes into the master branch of the acda_2017 repository by [Merging the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/)
