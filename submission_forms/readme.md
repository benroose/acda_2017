If a visiting institution team member wishes to edit or submit changes to a file within this repository then this can be accomplished in one of two methods:

1. The file can be downloaded from the [acda_2017 repository](https://github.com/benroose/acda_2017) using the github web interface
  1. The required file can be locally edited, and then emailed to the technical director, Ben Roose ([ben.roose@gmail.com](mailto:ben.roose@gmail.com)).
  2. Ben will then upload the newly received file back to the repository.
  3. Note that due to nature of this submission method, there will be limited version control and transparency available.
