 OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION

 "NONE OF THE BELOW TECH REQUESTS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN ACDA
If possible we would like the piece to be done with no softgoods in  including no cyc or curtain.  The piece is meant to see all of the backstage areas and to be an open and raw space.  Also the original piece had twenty (20) 8"" Fresnels lining the entire dance floor US and pointed/focused straight DS into the audience.  This was an integral part of the piece as it was the beginning and ending lighting cues that would be hard to see let go.  If possible  even having a fewer number of lights US would be great (even as few as three  which could at least represent one light for each of the three dancers).  Please contact me if you would like to discuss this idea further as these Fresnels would need to be cued into the show.  We began the show by having all of th Fresnels slowly fade up to 50% at the same time and then the next cue would take two sets of them down to 5% starting at centerline and working to the edges of the dance floor until they were all at 5%.  These cues were all autofollows.  Currently I have your cyc lights used in the cue sheet as a substitution for the audience blinders if this idea cannot be accomplished.  We appreciate anything you could do.  Thank you."
